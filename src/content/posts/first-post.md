So it is now Shopping September and here is all the damage I have inflicted so far. Mainly easy clothes to wear for going to class and looking cool on the weekends.


I finally pulled the trigger on this shirt thats been sitting in my ebay likes for over a year. Shes beautiful and the perfect length and fit
